    <h3>About DAH Solutions</h3>
    <p>
          DAH solutions originated in 2009 to fill a need in our community where
          the local health collaborative, employers and health plans wanted
          primary care practices to achieve NCQA-PCMH recognition. That
          challenge was that primary care practices did not have the staff or
          the experience to complete the requirements needed to meet the
          recognition standards and documentation. We rose to meet this
          challenge by supporting the collaborative, meeting with the practices
          to assess their current delivery of care compared to the NCQA standards
          at that time. Using a systematic approach we led each practice
          through the process, offering tools and support through the
          transformation of change. The last critical step was to compile the
          numerous pieces of information/reports into and easy to understand
          document to submit to NCQA. All practice  sites we worked with
          received the PCMH Recognition-level. At the same time we mentored the
          leadership within the health care systems to be supportive of the
          practice and to sustain the process and reporting even after they
          received the recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
          Since then DAH Solutions has worked with over 75 unique clients that
          represent over 300 practices of all types (large and small primary
          care groups, pediatric and Federally Qualified Health Centers)
          achieve the highest level possible (99.5% of all practices achieved a
          level 3 recognition).

                We highly recommend DAH Solutions. Their assessment, review of our
                processes, reports and examples,  and time line with monthly and
                weekly objectives were all vital to helping us achieve the level 3
                recognition! They were always available for phone or web
                conslutation throughout the process as they prepared us for
                submission to NCQA.
